[ 1 ] \n contents \n 1 history \n 2 definition \n 3 components \n 4 results \n 5 aiops vs. mlops \n 6 conferences \n 7 references \n history \n aiops was first defined by gartner in 2016 , [ 2 ] combining \" artificial intelligence \" and \" it operations \" to describe the application of ai and machine learning to enhance it operations . this concept was introduced to address the increasing complexity and data volume in it environments , aiming to automate processes such as event correlation , anomaly detection , and causality determination . \n definition \n aiops refers to the multi - layered complex technology platforms which enhance and automate it operations by using machine learning and analytics to analyze the large amounts of data collected from various devops devices and tools , automatically identifying and responding to issues in real - time . [ 3 ] aiops is used as a shift from isolated it data to aggregated observational data ( e . g . , job logs and monitoring systems ) and interaction data ( such as ticketing , events , or incident records ) within a big data platform [ 4 ] aiops applies machine learning and analytics to this data . the result is continuous visibility , which , combined with the implementation of automation , can lead to ongoing improvements . [ 5 ] aiops connects three it disciplines ( automation , service management , and performance management ) to achieve continuous visibility and improvement . this new approach in modern , accelerated , and hyper - scaled it environments leverages advances in machine learning and big data to overcome previous limitations . [ 6 ] \n aiops diagram \n components \n aiops consists of a number of components including the following processes and techniques : \n anomaly detection [ 7 ] \n log analysis [ 8 ] \n root cause analysis [ 9 ] \n cohort analysis [ 10 ] \n event correlation [ 11 ] \n predictive analytics [ 12 ] \n hardware failure prediction [ 13 ] \n automated remediation [ 14 ] \n performance prediction [ 15 ] \n incident management [ 16 ] \n causality determination [ 17 ] \n queue management [ 18 ] \n resource scheduling and optimization [ 19 ] \n predictive capacity management [ 16 ] \n resource allocation [ 19 ] \n service quality monitoring [ 19 ] \n deployment and integration testing [ 19 ] \n system configuration [ 19 ] \n auto - diagnosis and problem localization [ 19 ] \n efficient ml training and inferencing [ 19 ] \n using llms for cloud ops [ 19 ] \n auto service healing [ 16 ] \n data center management [ 19 ] \n customer support [ 19 ] \n security and privacy in cloud operations [ 19 ] \n results \n ai optimizes it operations in five ways : first , intelligent monitoring powered by ai helps identify potential issues before they cause outages , improving metrics like mean time to detect ( mttd ) by 15 - 20 % . second , performance data analysis and insights enable quick decision - making by ingesting and analyzing large data sets in real time . third , ai - driven automated infrastructure optimization efficiently allocates resources and thereby reducing cloud costs . fourth , enhanced it service management reduces critical incidents by over 50 % through ai - driven end - to - end service management . lastly , intelligent task automation accelerates problem resolution and automates remedial actions with minimal human intervention . [ 20 ] \n aiops vs. mlops \n aiops tools use big data analytics , machine learning algorithms , and predictive analytics to detect anomalies , correlate events , and provide proactive insights . this automation reduces the burden on it teams , allowing them to focus on strategic tasks rather than routine operational issues . aiops is widely used by it operations teams , devops , network administrators , and it service management ( itsm ) teams to enhance visibility and enable quicker incident resolution in hybrid cloud environments , data centers , and other it infrastructures . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] \n in contrast to mlops ( machine learning operations ) , which focuses on the life cycle management and operational aspects of machine learning models , aiops focuses on optimizing it operations using a variety of analytics and ai - driven techniques . while both disciplines rely on ai and data - driven methods , aiops primarily targets it operations , whereas mlops is concerned with the deployment , monitoring , and maintenance of ml models .

risks in maintenance training , aiming to bolster safety and credibility . key takeaways from these proposed revisions include : - fraud mitigation : targeting a reduction in cheating during examinations , particularly outside approved locations . - language proficiency : ensuring effective training through language comprehension . - management system : clarifying responsibilities and qualifications for personnel . - compliance measures : strengthening monitoring and examination security . - location restrictions : restricting training activities to approved locations . anticipated outcomes include a decrease in fraud and long - term improvement in maintenance competence . cheers to progress in the skies ! # easa # maintenance training # aviati onsafety # aircraft maintenance

maintaining this list . i was wondering if it should be the ipad pro 11-inch 3rd gen instead of the 5th gen ? \n https : / / the apple wiki . com / wiki / ipad _ pro _ ( 11 - inch ) _ ( 3 rd _ generation ) \n ipad 16 , 1 : ipad mini ( a 17 pro ) \n ipad 16 , 2 : ipad mini ( a 17 pro ) \n @ ioshc it has been discussed in past ( and not just once ) . there is no official naming from apple , so you can either take it as 3rd gen of ipad pro 11 \" or 5th gen of ipad pro ( regardles ds size ) , it 's up to interpretation . sometimes apple throws up some stupid pr ( like reusing old product names for new ones ) , some products even have gen , while others don ' t , for example latest model of ipad pro and ipad air doesn't have gen in name , they have m4 and m2 respectively , which again throws naming consitency into chaos . \n there are only 2 products that have continuous and understandable naming and thats watches ( disreganding 0 series ) , and iphone ( disregarding 2 g / 3 g / 3 gs ) . other products have no consistent or clear naming ( either it 's ipads , macs or macbooks ) . so there is 2 options , either use apple chaos , or create own naming scheme to help people distinguish between models . \n @ mex mer got it , thanks for you clarification , bro . \n @ adama wolf sorry if the question has already been asked but could you please consider adding apple tvs to this list ? i know it 's not a \" mobile \" device but i think it would make sense here . \n in any case , thanks for your work . \n sorry if the question has already been asked but could you please consider adding apple tvs to this list ? i know it 's not a \" mobile \" device but i think it would make sense here . \n for other device types , consider pinging the other mentioned repos & gists referenced in this gist . there are other sources to use . that way we keep this one purely for \" mobile \" . that and the fact that while very popular i can see , this gist shouldn't be the de facto standard for apple device mappings , there are others to choose from , and a repo version is a lot more desirable than a gist . \n fyi like half of the commercial names for the ipad ids are wrong , this needs to be corrected . \n \u8fd9 \u662f \u4e00\u5c01 \u81ea\u52a8 \u56de\u590d \u90ae\u4ef6 \u3002 \u60a8 \u7684 \u6765\u4fe1 \u5df2 \u6536\u5230 \uff0c \u6211\u4f1a \u5c3d\u5feb \u56de\u590d \n

\n yes , it 's quite possible , since it shares same cpu as iphone 16 , but i would hold with guesses , apple also might create hole ( as they sometimes do ) and mark it as iphone 17 , 6 \n ( * \uffe3

iphone 16 pro max code source \n \ud83d\ude04 haha \n it 's $ 599 in us , quite disapointing , since it 's 40 % hike up ( iphone se 2022 was selling for $ 429 ) , i would not say value is terrible , but definetly it doesn't fall to budget phone category . \n according to apple website , they will be available next friday ( eg . 28 . 2 . ) , but tomorow starts preorders . but if you get one , please post identification here . \n due to the needs of the company 's internal business , we need to maintain this mapping relationship for a long time . now put it on github , friends who need it can check it out \n [ apple - device - model ] \n iphone 16e is iphone 17 , 5 as confirmed in the xcode 16.3 beta ( device _ traits . db ) :"}}}

You are preparing an in-depth diligence brief on "{company}".

Use ONLY the provided source packets; each packet begins with "Source N". If a claim is not grounded in those packets, explicitly note it as an open question.

When drafting the brief:
- Highlight leadership, funding, market focus, go-to-market motion, major products, technical differentiators, traction, partnerships, risks, and opportunities.
- Call out quantitative metrics (customers, revenue, funding, headcount, etc.) when available.
- Tie every insight back to specific sources using bracketed citations like [Source 2].
- Capture contradictions or missing data as risks or recommended follow-up work.

Context packets:

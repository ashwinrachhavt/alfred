Extract a structured experience inventory from the provided context.

Rules:
- Use only details supported by the provided context.
- Prefer impact with numbers; if no numbers exist, use specific outcomes without fabricating metrics.
- Keep skills/technologies as short canonical strings (e.g., "LangGraph", "FastAPI", "Postgres", "AWS").
- Headline should be a single line, first person, differentiating.
